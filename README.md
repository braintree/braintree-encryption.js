# Braintree.js

This library is for use with [Braintree's payment gateway](http://braintreepayments.com/) in concert with one of [the supported client libraries](http://braintreepayments.com/docs).  It encrypts sensitive payment information in a web browser using the public key of an asymmetric key pair.

> :grey_exclamation: Notice: `braintree-encryption.js` is an older integration method - [braintree-web](https://github.com/braintree/braintree-web) is the place to go for current integrations and filing issues or PRs.
